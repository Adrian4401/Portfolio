    about_me: "I’m a young, energetic, and ambitious Junior Fullstack Developer with a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. I’m passionate about building websites and web applications, and I’m looking to grow in an environment that values code quality, collaboration, and initiative.<br></br>During my studies, I gained hands-on experience — first as an intern, and later as a team member working on real-world projects, including a CMS system built with Vue 3. This allowed me to strengthen my programming skills, learn best practices, and understand how the IT industry operates.<br></br>I’m highly motivated to continue developing as a programmer — I enjoy exploring new technologies, improving my skills, and contributing to exciting projects. If you’re looking for a dedicated, reliable, and communicative junior developer — let’s get in touch!",
